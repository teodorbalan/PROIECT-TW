                <h2>Intellectual Pursuits & Professional Growth</h2>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>My intellectual journey has been driven by a fascination with the intersection of AI and medicine. This was ignited at **Stanford's Neuroengineering course**, where I developed a machine-learning program to predict Palsy disease in children. Following this, I collaborated on a research project at **Columbia and John Hopkins**, using K-means clustering to analyze the behavior of ganglion cells. These experiences strengthened my resolve to contribute to medical advancements through AI.</p>
                    <p>My professional growth started at **Soft31**, a software company in Romania, where I was the youngest programmer. I quickly learned multiple languages and collaborated with colleagues to build a machine-learning app that connects symptoms to diseases. This project was a major milestone, as our program was acquired by Regina Maria, a premier private hospital network in Romania.</p>

                <h2>Extracurricular Activities & Community</h2>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>My commitment to using my skills for good is demonstrated through my volunteering with **KAIA ONG**. I started by teaching English and Romanian to Ukrainian refugee children and later took the initiative to organize cultural outings to help them feel welcomed and integrated into our society. I believe in giving back to the community and helping the less fortunate.</p>
                    <p>For six years, I was a member of the **Nerdvana robotics team**, where I was the lead programmer. My expertise in computer vision and data analysis allowed me to create a sophisticated PID algorithm that greatly enhanced our robot's navigation. We qualified for the World Robotics Olympiad multiple times, achieving a remarkable 8th-place finish in 2022.</p>

                <h2>Personal Insights & Values</h2>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>My friends and colleagues know me for my enthusiasm and problem-solving skills, which were first sparked by a childhood fascination with the Tower of Hanoi. I enjoy challenging discussions, sports like soccer and basketball, and embracing a philosophy of "do more with less"â€”a mindset honed by my robotics experience.</p>
                    <p>I also have a passion for mental wellness, having volunteered with an NGO that supports young people with mental challenges. This experience has shaped me into someone who listens without judgment and is always ready to lend an ear.</p>
